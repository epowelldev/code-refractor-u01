Code Refractor for 'Horiseon Marketing', Unit 01 Homework for Full Stack Flex Bootcamp

## Description
This project was made to practice taking code from a project lacking in semantic and accessibility standards, and updating the code so it is more readable without changing how the site looks/operates.

* No semantic tags

Reordered CSS and combined redundant styles.
Added comments to CSS.
Added alt tags to HTML images.

Lastly, I added the following screenshot and link to deployed site on github:
