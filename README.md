Code Refractor for 'Horiseon Marketing', Unit 01 Homework for Full Stack Flex Bootcamp

## Description
This project was made to practice taking code from a project lacking in semantic and accessibility standards, and updating the code so it is more readable without changing how the site looks/operates.

## Flow of Work

First off, I skimmed the HTML to find the major changes:
* No title
* No semantic tags
* Using the same name for ID and CLASS in the same div (no ID in the css either)
